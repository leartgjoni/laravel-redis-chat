# Laravel Redis Chat

This is a real-time chat based on Laravel, Node.js, Socket.io and Redis to link Laravel with Node.Js<br/>
The application sends messages in real-time using socket.io as well as keeps them on db for later.<br/>
<b>Usually chat examples online offer public chat features. This project offers one-to-one chat!</b>

# How to run the app
	composer install
	npm install
	node nodejs/server.js
	php artisan serve

Keep in mind that you need redis-server installed on your machine for the application to work.
